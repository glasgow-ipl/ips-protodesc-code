6.1.  RTCP Packet Format

   An RTCP packet can have the following formats:

   o  SR: Sender report (as defined in Section 6.4.1).  For transmission
      and reception statistics from participants that are active
      senders.

   o  RR: Receiver report (as defined in Section 6.4.2).  For reception
      statistics from participants that are not active senders and in
      combination with SR for active senders reporting on more than 31
      sources

   o  SDES: Source description items (as defined in Section 6.5).
      Including CNAME.

   o  BYE: Indicates end of participation (as defined in Section 6.6)

   o  APP: Application-specific functions (as defined in Section 6.7)

   Each RTCP packet begins with a fixed part similar to that of RTP data
   packets, followed by structured elements that MAY be of variable
   length according to the packet type but MUST end on a 32-bit
   boundary.  The alignment requirement and a length field in the fixed
   part of each packet are included to make RTCP packets "stackable".
   Multiple RTCP packets can be concatenated without any intervening
   separators to form a compound RTCP packet that is sent in a single
   packet of the lower layer protocol, for example UDP.  There is no
   explicit count of individual RTCP packets in the compound packet
   since the lower layer protocols are expected to provide an overall
   length to determine the end of the compound packet.

   Each individual RTCP packet in the compound packet may be processed
   independently with no requirements upon the order or combination of
   packets.  However, in order to perform the functions of the protocol,
   the following constraints are imposed:

   o  Reception statistics (in SR or RR) should be sent as often as
      bandwidth constraints will allow to maximize the resolution of the
      statistics, therefore each periodically transmitted compound RTCP
      packet MUST include a report packet.

   o  New receivers need to receive the CNAME for a source as soon as
      possible to identify the source and to begin associating media for
      purposes such as lip-sync, so each compound RTCP packet MUST also
      include the SDES CNAME except when the compound RTCP packet is
      split for partial encryption as described in Section 9.1.

   o  The number of packet types that may appear first in the compound
      packet needs to be limited to increase the number of constant bits
      in the first word and the probability of successfully validating
      RTCP packets against misaddressed RTP data packets or other
      unrelated packets.

   Thus, all RTCP packets MUST be sent in a compound packet of at least
   two individual packets, with the following format:

  Encryption prefix:  If and only if the compound packet is to be
      encrypted according to the method in Section 9.1, it MUST be
      prefixed by a random 32-bit quantity redrawn for every compound
      packet transmitted.  If padding is required for the encryption, it
      MUST be added to the last packet of the compound packet.

  SR or RR:  The first RTCP packet in the compound packet MUST
      always be a report packet to facilitate header validation as
      described in Appendix A.2.  This is true even if no data has been
      sent or received, in which case an empty RR MUST be sent, and even
      if the only other RTCP packet in the compound packet is a BYE.

  Additional RRs:  If the number of sources for which reception
      statistics are being reported exceeds 31, the number that will fit
      into one SR or RR packet, then additional RR packets SHOULD follow
      the initial report packet.

  SDES:  An SDES packet containing a CNAME item MUST be included
      in each compound RTCP packet, except as noted in Section 9.1.
      Other source description items MAY optionally be included if
      required by a particular application, subject to bandwidth
      constraints (see Section 6.3.9).

  BYE or APP:  Other RTCP packet types, including those yet to be
      defined, MAY follow in any order, except that BYE SHOULD be the
      last packet sent with a given SSRC/CSRC.  Packet types MAY appear
      more than once.

   An individual RTP participant SHOULD send only one compound RTCP
   packet per report interval in order for the RTCP bandwidth per
   participant to be estimated correctly (see Section 6.2), except when
   the compound RTCP packet is split for partial encryption as described
   in Section 9.1.  If there are too many sources to fit all the
   necessary RR packets into one compound RTCP packet without exceeding
   the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the network path, then only
   the subset that will fit into one MTU SHOULD be included in each
   interval.  The subsets SHOULD be selected round-robin across multiple
   intervals so that all sources are reported.

   It is RECOMMENDED that translators and mixers combine individual RTCP
   packets from the multiple sources they are forwarding into one
   compound packet whenever feasible in order to amortize the packet
   overhead (see Section 7).  An example RTCP compound packet as might
   be produced by a mixer is shown in Fig. 1.  If the overall length of
   a compound packet would exceed the MTU of the network path, it SHOULD
   be segmented into multiple shorter compound packets to be transmitted
   in separate packets of the underlying protocol.  This does not impair
   the RTCP bandwidth estimation because each compound packet represents
   at least one distinct participant.  Note that each of the compound
   packets MUST begin with an SR or RR packet.

   An implementation SHOULD ignore incoming RTCP packets with types
   unknown to it.  Additional RTCP packet types may be registered with
   the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as described in
   Section 15.

6.4.  Sender and Receiver Reports

   RTP receivers provide reception quality feedback using RTCP report
   packets which may take one of two forms depending upon whether or not
   the receiver is also a sender.  The only difference between the
   sender report (SR) and receiver report (RR) forms, besides the packet
   type code, is that the sender report includes a 20-byte sender
   information section for use by active senders.  The SR is issued if a
   site has sent any data packets during the interval since issuing the
   last report or the previous one, otherwise the RR is issued.

   Both the SR and RR forms include zero or more reception report
   blocks, one for each of the synchronization sources from which this
   receiver has received RTP data packets since the last report.
   Reports are not issued for contributing sources listed in the CSRC
   list.  Each reception report block provides statistics about the data
   received from the particular source indicated in that block.  Since a
   maximum of 31 reception report blocks will fit in an SR or RR packet,
   additional RR packets SHOULD be stacked after the initial SR or RR
   packet as needed to contain the reception reports for all sources
   heard during the interval since the last report.  If there are too
   many sources to fit all the necessary RR packets into one compound
   RTCP packet without exceeding the MTU of the network path, then only
   the subset that will fit into one MTU SHOULD be included in each
   interval.  The subsets SHOULD be selected round-robin across multiple
   intervals so that all sources are reported.

   The next sections define the formats of the two reports, how they may
   be extended in a profile-specific manner if an application requires
   additional feedback information, and how the reports may be used.
   Details of reception reporting by translators and mixers is given in
   Section 7.

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The sender report packet consists of three sections, possibly
   followed by a fourth profile-specific extension section if defined.
   The first section, the header, is 8 octets long.  The fields have the
   following meaning:

   version (V): 2 bits

      Identifies the version of RTP, which is the same in RTCP packets
      as in RTP data packets.  The version defined by this specification
      is two (2).

   padding (P): 1 bit

      If the padding bit is set, this individual RTCP packet contains
      some additional padding octets at the end which are not part of
      the control information but are included in the length field.  The
      last octet of the padding is a count of how many padding octets
      should be ignored, including itself (it will be a multiple of
      four).  Padding may be needed by some encryption algorithms with
      fixed block sizes.  In a compound RTCP packet, padding is only
      required on one individual packet because the compound packet is
      encrypted as a whole for the method in Section 9.1.  Thus, padding
      MUST only be added to the last individual packet, and if padding
      is added to that packet, the padding bit MUST be set only on that
      packet.  This convention aids the header validity checks described
      in Appendix A.2 and allows detection of packets from some early
      implementations that incorrectly set the padding bit on the first
      individual packet and add padding to the last individual packet.

   reception report count (RC): 5 bits

      The number of reception report blocks contained in this packet.  A
      value of zero is valid.

   packet type (PT): 8 bits

      Contains the constant 200 to identify this as an RTCP SR packet.

   length: 16 bits

      The length of this RTCP packet in 32-bit words minus one,
      including the header and any padding.  (The offset of one makes
      zero a valid length and avoids a possible infinite loop in
      scanning a compound RTCP packet, while counting 32-bit words
      avoids a validity check for a multiple of 4.)

   SSRC: 32 bits

      The synchronization source identifier for the originator of this
      SR packet.

   The second section, the sender information, is 20 octets long and is
   present in every sender report packet.  It summarizes the data
   transmissions from this sender.  The fields have the following
   meaning:

   NTP timestamp: 64 bits

      Indicates the wallclock time (see Section 4) when this report was
      sent so that it may be used in combination with timestamps
      returned in reception reports from other receivers to measure



Schulzrinne, et al.      Expires January 2, 2004               [Page 36]

      round-trip propagation to those receivers.  Receivers should
      expect that the measurement accuracy of the timestamp may be
      limited to far less than the resolution of the NTP timestamp.  The
      measurement uncertainty of the timestamp is not indicated as it
      may not be known.  On a system that has no notion of wallclock
      time but does have some system-specific clock such as "system
      uptime", a sender MAY use that clock as a reference to calculate
      relative NTP timestamps.  It is important to choose a commonly
      used clock so that if separate implementations are used to produce
      the individual streams of a multimedia session, all
      implementations will use the same clock.  Until the year 2036,
      relative and absolute timestamps will differ in the high bit so
      (invalid) comparisons will show a large difference; by then one
      hopes relative timestamps will no longer be needed.  A sender that
      has no notion of wallclock or elapsed time MAY set the NTP
      timestamp to zero.

   RTP timestamp: 32 bits

      Corresponds to the same time as the NTP timestamp (above), but in
      the same units and with the same random offset as the RTP
      timestamps in data packets.  This correspondence may be used for
      intra- and inter-media synchronization for sources whose NTP
      timestamps are synchronized, and may be used by media-independent
      receivers to estimate the nominal RTP clock frequency.  Note that
      in most cases this timestamp will not be equal to the RTP
      timestamp in any adjacent data packet.  Rather, it MUST be
      calculated from the corresponding NTP timestamp using the
      relationship between the RTP timestamp counter and real time as
      maintained by periodically checking the wallclock time at a
      sampling instant.

   sender's packet count: 32 bits

      The total number of RTP data packets transmitted by the sender
      since starting transmission up until the time this SR packet was
      generated.  The count SHOULD be reset if the sender changes its
      SSRC identifier.

   sender's octet count: 32 bits

      The total number of payload octets (i.e., not including header or
      padding) transmitted in RTP data packets by the sender since
      starting transmission up until the time this SR packet was
      generated.  The count SHOULD be reset if the sender changes its
      SSRC identifier.  This field can be used to estimate the average
      payload data rate.

   The third section contains zero or more reception report blocks
   depending on the number of other sources heard by this sender since
   the last report.  Each reception report block conveys statistics on
   the reception of RTP packets from a single synchronization source.
   Receivers SHOULD NOT carry over statistics when a source changes its
   SSRC identifier due to a collision.  These statistics are:

   SSRC_n (source identifier): 32 bits

      The SSRC identifier of the source to which the information in this
      reception report block pertains.

   fraction lost: 8 bits

      The fraction of RTP data packets from source SSRC_n lost since the
      previous SR or RR packet was sent, expressed as a fixed point
      number with the binary point at the left edge of the field.  (That
      is equivalent to taking the integer part after multiplying the
      loss fraction by 256.)  This fraction is defined to be the number
      of packets lost divided by the number of packets expected, as
      defined in the next paragraph.  An implementation is shown in
      Appendix A.3.  If the loss is negative due to duplicates, the
      fraction lost is set to zero.  Note that a receiver cannot tell
      whether any packets were lost after the last one received, and
      that there will be no reception report block issued for a source
      if all packets from that source sent during the last reporting
      interval have been lost.

   cumulative number of packets lost: 24 bits

      The total number of RTP data packets from source SSRC_n that have
      been lost since the beginning of reception.  This number is
      defined to be the number of packets expected less the number of
      packets actually received, where the number of packets received
      includes any which are late or duplicates.  Thus, packets that
      arrive late are not counted as lost, and the loss may be negative
      if there are duplicates.  The number of packets expected is
      defined to be the extended last sequence number received, as
      defined next, less the initial sequence number received.  This may
      be calculated as shown in Appendix A.3.

   extended highest sequence number received: 32 bits

      The low 16 bits contain the highest sequence number received in an
      RTP data packet from source SSRC_n, and the most significant 16
      bits extend that sequence number with the corresponding count of
      sequence number cycles, which may be maintained according to the
      algorithm in Appendix A.1.  Note that different receivers within

Internet-Draft                     RTP                         July 2003


      the same session will generate different extensions to the
      sequence number if their start times differ significantly.

   interarrival jitter: 32 bits

      An estimate of the statistical variance of the RTP data packet
      interarrival time, measured in timestamp units and expressed as an
      unsigned integer.  The interarrival jitter J is defined to be the
      mean deviation (smoothed absolute value) of the difference D in
      packet spacing at the receiver compared to the sender for a pair
      of packets.  As shown in the equation below, this is equivalent to
      the difference in the "relative transit time" for the two packets;
      the relative transit time is the difference between a packet's RTP
      timestamp and the receiver's clock at the time of arrival,
      measured in the same units.

      If Si is the RTP timestamp from packet i, and Ri is the time of
      arrival in RTP timestamp units for packet i, then for two packets
      i and j, D may be expressed as

          D(i,j) = (Rj - Ri) - (Sj - Si) = (Rj - Sj) - (Ri - Si)

      The interarrival jitter SHOULD be calculated continuously as each
      data packet i is received from source SSRC_n, using this
      difference D for that packet and the previous packet i-1 in order
      of arrival (not necessarily in sequence), according to the formula

          J(i) = J(i-1) + (|D(i-1,i)| - J(i-1))/16

      Whenever a reception report is issued, the current value of J is
      sampled.

      The jitter calculation MUST conform to the formula specified here
      in order to allow profile-independent monitors to make valid
      interpretations of reports coming from different implementations.
      This algorithm is the optimal first-order estimator and the gain
      parameter 1/16 gives a good noise reduction ratio while
      maintaining a reasonable rate of convergence [22].  A sample
      implementation is shown in Appendix A.8.  See Section 6.4.4 for a
      discussion of the effects of varying packet duration and delay
      before transmission.

   last SR timestamp (LSR): 32 bits

      The middle 32 bits out of 64 in the NTP timestamp (as explained in
      Section 4) received as part of the most recent RTCP sender report
      (SR) packet from source SSRC_n.  If no SR has been received yet,
      the field is set to zero.

Internet-Draft                     RTP                         July 2003


   delay since last SR (DLSR): 32 bits

      The delay, expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds, between
      receiving the last SR packet from source SSRC_n and sending this
      reception report block.  If no SR packet has been received yet
      from SSRC_n, the DLSR field is set to zero.

      Let SSRC_r denote the receiver issuing this receiver report.
      Source SSRC_n can compute the round-trip propagation delay to
      SSRC_r by recording the time A when this reception report block is
      received.  It calculates the total round-trip time A-LSR using the
      last SR timestamp (LSR) field, and then subtracting this field to
      leave the round-trip propagation delay as (A - LSR - DLSR).  This
      is illustrated in Fig. 2.  Times are shown in both a hexadecimal
      representation of the 32-bit fields and the equivalent floating-
      point decimal representation.  Colons indicate a 32-bit field
      divided into a 16-bit integer part and 16-bit fraction part.

   This may be used as an approximate measure of distance to cluster
   receivers, although some links have very asymmetric delays.

   The format of the receiver report (RR) packet is the same as that of
   the SR packet except that the packet type field contains the constant
   201 and the five words of sender information are omitted (these are
   the NTP and RTP timestamps and sender's packet and octet counts).
   The remaining fields have the same meaning as for the SR packet.

   An empty RR packet (RC = 0) MUST be put at the head of a compound
   RTCP packet when there is no data transmission or reception to
   report.

   The SDES packet is a three-level structure composed of a header and
   zero or more chunks, each of which is composed of items describing
   the source identified in that chunk.  The items are described
   individually in subsequent sections.

   version (V), padding (P), length:

      As described for the SR packet (see Section 6.4.1).

   packet type (PT): 8 bits

      Contains the constant 202 to identify this as an RTCP SDES packet.

   source count (SC): 5 bits

      The number of SSRC/CSRC chunks contained in this SDES packet.  A
      value of zero is valid but useless.

   Each chunk consists of an SSRC/CSRC identifier followed by a list of
   zero or more items, which carry information about the SSRC/CSRC.
   Each chunk starts on a 32-bit boundary.  Each item consists of an 8-
   bit type field, an 8-bit octet count describing the length of the
   text (thus, not including this two-octet header), and the text
   itself.  Note that the text can be no longer than 255 octets, but
   this is consistent with the need to limit RTCP bandwidth consumption.
   The text is encoded according to the UTF-8 encoding specified in RFC
   2279 [5].  US-ASCII is a subset of this encoding and requires no

Internet-Draft                     RTP                         July 2003


   additional encoding.  The presence of multi-octet encodings is
   indicated by setting the most significant bit of a character to a
   value of one.

   Items are contiguous, i.e., items are not individually padded to a
   32-bit boundary.  Text is not null terminated because some multi-
   octet encodings include null octets.  The list of items in each chunk
   MUST be terminated by one or more null octets, the first of which is
   interpreted as an item type of zero to denote the end of the list.
   No length octet follows the null item type octet, but additional null
   octets MUST be included if needed to pad until the next 32-bit
   boundary.  Note that this padding is separate from that indicated by
   the P bit in the RTCP header.  A chunk with zero items (four null
   octets) is valid but useless.

   End systems send one SDES packet containing their own source
   identifier (the same as the SSRC in the fixed RTP header).  A mixer
   sends one SDES packet containing a chunk for each contributing source
   from which it is receiving SDES information, or multiple complete
   SDES packets in the format above if there are more than 31 such
   sources (see Section 7).

   The SDES items currently defined are described in the next sections.
   Only the CNAME item is mandatory.  Some items shown here may be
   useful only for particular profiles, but the item types are all
   assigned from one common space to promote shared use and to simplify
   profile-independent applications.  Additional items may be defined in
   a profile by registering the type numbers with IANA as described in
   Section 15.

6.5.2.  NAME: User Name SDES Item

    0                   1                   2                   3

   |     NAME=2    |     length    | common name of source       ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   This is the real name used to describe the source, e.g., "John Doe,
   Bit Recycler".  It may be in any form desired by the user.  For
   applications such as conferencing, this form of name may be the most
   desirable for display in participant lists, and therefore might be
   sent most frequently of those items other than CNAME.  Profiles MAY
   establish such priorities.  The NAME value is expected to remain
   constant at least for the duration of a session.  It SHOULD NOT be
   relied upon to be unique among all participants in the session.

6.5.3.  EMAIL: Electronic Mail Address SDES Item

   The email address is formatted according to RFC 2822 [9], for
   example, "John.Doe@example.com".  The EMAIL value is expected to
   remain constant for the duration of a session.

   The phone number SHOULD be formatted with the plus sign replacing the
   international access code.  For example, "+1 908 555 1212" for a
   number in the United States.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Depending on the application, different degrees of detail are
   appropriate for this item.  For conference applications, a string
   like "Murray Hill, New Jersey" may be sufficient, while, for an
   active badge system, strings like "Room 2A244, AT&T BL MH" might be
   appropriate.  The degree of detail is left to the implementation and/
   or user, but format and content MAY be prescribed by a profile.  The
   LOC value is expected to remain constant for the duration of a
   session, except for mobile hosts.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   A string giving the name and possibly version of the application
   generating the stream, e.g., "videotool 1.2".  This information may
   be useful for debugging purposes and is similar to the Mailer or
   Mail-System-Version SMTP headers.  The TOOL value is expected to
   remain constant for the duration of the session.6.5.7 NOTE: Notice/

   The following semantics are suggested for this item, but these or
   other semantics MAY be explicitly defined by a profile.  The NOTE
   item is intended for transient messages describing the current state
   of the source, e.g., "on the phone, can't talk".  Or, during a
   seminar, this item might be used to convey the title of the talk.  It
   should be used only to carry exceptional information and SHOULD NOT
   be included routinely by all participants because this would slow
   down the rate at which reception reports and CNAME are sent, thus
   impairing the performance of the protocol.  In particular, it SHOULD
   NOT be included as an item in a user's configuration file nor
   automatically generated as in a quote-of-the-day.

   Since the NOTE item may be important to display while it is active,
   the rate at which other non-CNAME items such as NAME are transmitted
   might be reduced so that the NOTE item can take that part of the RTCP
   bandwidth.  When the transient message becomes inactive, the NOTE
   item SHOULD continue to be transmitted a few times at the same
   repetition rate but with a string of length zero to signal the
   receivers.  However, receivers SHOULD also consider the NOTE item
   inactive if it is not received for a small multiple of the repetition
   rate, or perhaps 20-30 RTCP intervals.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   This item is used to define experimental or application-specific SDES
   extensions.  The item contains a prefix consisting of a length-string
   pair, followed by the value string filling the remainder of the item
   and carrying the desired information.  The prefix length field is 8
   bits long.  The prefix string is a name chosen by the person defining
   the PRIV item to be unique with respect to other PRIV items this
   application might receive.  The application creator might choose to
   use the application name plus an additional subtype identification if
   needed.  Alternatively, it is RECOMMENDED that others choose a name

   based on the entity they represent, then coordinate the use of the
   name within that entity.

   Note that the prefix consumes some space within the item's total
   length of 255 octets, so the prefix should be kept as short as
   possible.  This facility and the constrained RTCP bandwidth SHOULD
   NOT be overloaded; it is not intended to satisfy all the control
   communication requirements of all applications.

   SDES PRIV prefixes will not be registered by IANA.  If some form of
   the PRIV item proves to be of general utility, it SHOULD instead be
   assigned a regular SDES item type registered with IANA so that no
   prefix is required.  This simplifies use and increases transmission
   efficiency.

   If a BYE packet is received by a mixer, the mixer SHOULD forward the
   BYE packet with the SSRC/CSRC identifier(s) unchanged.  If a mixer
   shuts down, it SHOULD send a BYE packet listing all contributing
   sources it handles, as well as its own SSRC identifier.  Optionally,
   the BYE packet MAY include an 8-bit octet count followed by that many
   octets of text indicating the reason for leaving, e.g., "camera
   malfunction" or "RTP loop detected".  The string has the same
   encoding as that described for SDES.  If the string fills the packet
   to the next 32-bit boundary, the string is not null terminated.  If
   not, the BYE packet MUST be padded with null octets to the next 32-
   bit boundary.  This padding is separate from that indicated by the P
   bit in the RTCP header.
