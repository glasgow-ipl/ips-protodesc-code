              This document describes a machine-readable format for specifying
              the syntax of protocol data units within a protocol specification.
              This format is comprised of a consistently formatted packet header
              diagram, followed by structured explanatory text. It is
              designed to maintain human readability while enabling support for
              automated parser generation from the specification document. This
              document is itself an example of how the format can be used.

                Packet header diagrams have become a widely used format for
                describing the syntax of binary protocols. In otherwise largely textual
                documents, they allow for the visualisation of packet formats, reducing
                human error, and aiding in the implementation of parsers for the protocols
                that they specify.
            </t>
            <t>
                <xref target="tcp-header-format"/> gives an example of how packet
                header diagrams are used to define binary protocol formats. The format
                has an obvious structure: the diagram clearly delineates each field,
                showing its width and its position within the header. This type of diagram is
                designed for human readers, but is consistent enough that it should
                be possible to develop a tool that generates a parser for the packet
                format from the diagram.

                Unfortunately, the format of such packet diagrams varies both within
                and between documents. This variation makes it difficult to build
                tools to generate parsers from the specifications. Better tooling
                could be developed if protocol specifications adopted a consistent
                format for their packet descriptions. Indeed,
                this underpins the format described by this draft: we want to
                retain the benefits that packet header diagrams provide, while identifying
                the benefits of adopting a consistent format.
             </t>
            <t>
                This document describes a consistent packet header diagram format and
                accompanying structured text constructs that allow for the parsing process
                of protocol headers to be fully specified. This provides support for the
                automatic generation of parser code. Broad design principles, that seek
                to maintain the primacy of human readability and flexibility in
                writing, are described, before the format itself is given.
            </t>
            <t>
                This document is itself an example of the approach that it describes, with
                the packet header diagrams and structured text format described by example.
                Examples that do not form part of the protocol description language are
                marked by a colon at the beginning of each line; this prevents them from
                being parsed by the accompanying tooling.

                This draft describes early work. As consensus builds around the
                particular syntax of the format described, both a formal ABNF
                specification (<xref target="ABNF"/>) and code (<xref target="source"/>) that
                parses it (and, as described above, this document) will be provided.

            <t>
                This section begins by considering how packet header diagrams are
                used in existing documents. This exposes the limitations that the current
                usage has in terms of machine-readability, guiding the design of the
                format that this document proposes.

            <t>
                While this document focuses on the machine-readability of packet format
                diagrams, this section also discusses the use of other structured or formal
                languages within IETF documents. Considering how and why these languages
                are used provides an instructive contrast to the relatively incremental
                approach proposed here.

                <t>
                  Packet header diagrams are frequently used in IETF standards to describe the
                  format of binary protocols. While there is no standard for how
                  these diagrams should be formatted, they have a broadly similar structure,
                  where the layout of a protocol data unit (PDU) or structure is shown in
                  diagrammatic form, followed by a description list of the fields that it
                  contains. An example of this format, taken from the QUIC specification,
                  is given in <xref target="quic-reset-stream"/>.
                </t>

                <t>
                  These packet header diagrams, and the accompanying descriptions, are
                  formatted for human readers rather than for automated processing. As
                  a result, while there is rough consistency in how packet header diagrams are
                  formatted, there are a number of limitations that make them difficult
                  to work with programmatically:
                </t>
                <dl>
                  <dt>
                    Inconsistent syntax:
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                    <t>
                      There are two classes of consistency that are needed to support
                      automated processing of specifications: internal consistency
                      within a diagram or document, and external consistency across
                      all documents.
                    </t>
                      <t>
                        <xref target="quic-reset-stream"/> gives an example of internal
                        inconsistency. Here, the packet diagram shows a field labelled
                        "Application Error Code", while the accompanying description lists
                        the field as "Application Protocol Error Code". The use of an
                        abbreviated name is suitable for human readers, but makes parsing
                        the structure difficult for machines.

                        <xref target="dhcpv6-relaysrcopt"/> gives a further example, where
                        the description includes an "Option-Code" field that does not appear
                        in the packet diagram; and where the description states that
                        each field is 16 bits in length, but the diagram shows
                        the OPTION_RELAY_PORT as 13 bits, and Option-Len as 19 bits.

                        Another example is <xref target="RFC6958"/>, where the packet
                        format diagram showing the structure of the Burst/Gap Loss Metrics
                        Report Block shows the Number of Bursts field as being 12 bits wide
                        but the corresponding text describes it as 16 bits.
                      </t>

                      <t>
                        Comparing <xref target="quic-reset-stream"/> with
                        <xref target="dhcpv6-relaysrcopt"/> exposes external
                        inconsistency across documents. While the packet format
                        diagrams are broadly similar, the surrounding text is
                        formatted differently. If machine parsing is to be made
                        possible, then this text must be structured consistently.

                      Ambiguous constraints:

                    <dd>
                      The constraints that are enforced on a particular field are often
                      described ambiguously, or in a way that cannot be parsed easily.
                      In <xref target="dhcpv6-relaysrcopt"/>, each of the three fields
                      in the structure is constrained. The first two fields
                      ("Option-Code" and "Option-Len") are to be set to constant values
                      (note the inconsistency in how these constraints are expressed in
                      the description). However, the third field ("Downstream Source
                      Port") can take a value from a constrained set. This constraint
                      is expressed in prose that cannot readily by understood by machine.

                        Protocol data units and other structures are often comprised of
                        sub-structures that are defined elsewhere, either in the same
                        document, or within another document. Chaining these structures
                        together is essential for machine parsing: the parsing process for
                        a protocol data unit is only fully expressed if all elements can
                        be parsed.
                      </t>
                      <t>
                        <xref target="quic-reset-stream"/> highlights the difficulty that
                        machine parsers have in chaining structures together. Two fields
                        ("Stream ID" and "Final Size") are described as being encoded as
                        variable-length integers; this is a structure described elsewhere
                        in the same document. Structured text is required both alongside
                        the definition of the containing structure and with the definition
                        of the sub-structure, to allow a parser to link the two together.

                        <t>
                            Protocols are often specified across multiple documents, either
                            because the protocol explicitly includes extension points (e.g.,
                            profiles and payload format specifications in RTP
                            <xref target="RFC3550"/>) or because definition of a protocol
                            data unit has changed and evolved over time. As a result, it is
                            essential that syntax be provided to allow for a complete
                            definition of a protocol's parsing process to be constructed
                            across multiple documents.

                <name>Formal languages in standards documents</name>

                <t>
                    A small proportion of IETF standards documents contain
                    structured and formal languages, including ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/>,
                    ASN.1 <xref target="ASN1"/>, C, CBOR <xref target="RFC7049"/>, JSON,
                    the TLS presentation language <xref target="RFC8446"/>, YANG models
                    <xref target="RFC7950"/>, and XML. While this broad
                    range of languages may be problematic for the development of tooling
                    to parse specifications, these, and other, languages serve a range of
                    different use cases. ABNF, for example, is typically used to specify
                    text protocols, while ASN.1 is used to specify data structure
                    serialisation. This document specifies a structured language for specifying
                    the parsing of binary protocol data units.

            <name>Design Principles</name>
            <t>
                The use of structures that are designed to support machine readability
                might potentially interfere with the existing ways in which protocol
                specifications are used and authored. To the extent that these existing uses
                are more important than machine readability, such interference must be
                minimised.
            </t>
            <t>
                In this section, the broad design principles that underpin the format
                described by this document are given. However, these principles apply more
                generally to any approach that introduces structured and formal languages
                into standards documents.
            </t>
            <t>
                It should be noted that these are design principles: they expose the
                trade-offs that are inherent within any given approach. Violating these
                principles is sometimes necessary and beneficial, and this document sets
                out the potential consequences of doing so.
            </t>
            <t>
                The central tenet that underpins these design principles is a recognition
                that the standardisation process is not broken, and so does not need to be
                fixed. Failure to recognise this will likely lead to approaches that are
                incompatible with the standards process, or that will see limited
                adoption. However, the standards process can be improved with appropriate
                approaches, as guided by the following broad design principles:
            </t>
            <dl>
                <dt>
                    Most readers are human:
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    <t>
                        Primarily, standards documents should be written for people, who
                        require text and diagrams that they can understand. Structures that
                        cannot be easily parsed by people should be avoided, and if
                        included, should be clearly delineated from human-readable
                        content.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Any approach that shifts this balance -- that is, that primarily
                        targets machine readers -- is likely to be disruptive to the
                        standardisation process, which relies upon discussion centered
                        around documents written in prose.
                    </t>
                </dd>

                <dt>
                    Writing tools are diverse:
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    <t>
                        Standards document writing is a distributed process that involves a diverse set of
                        tools and workflows. The introduction of machine-readable
                        structures into specifications should not require that specific tools are
                        used to produce standards documents, to ensure that disruption to
                        existing workflows is minimised. This does not preclude the
                        development of optional, supplementary tools that aid in the
                        authoring machine-readable structures.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The immediate impact of requiring specific tooling is that
                        adoption is likely to be limited. A long-term impact might be that
                        authors whose workflows are incompatible might be alienated from
                        the process.
                    </t>
                </dd>

                <dt>
                    Canonical specifications:
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    <t>
                        As far as possible, machine-readable structures should not
                        replicate the human readable specification of the protocol
                        within the same document. Machine-readable structures should form part
                        of a canonical specification of the protocol. Adding supplementary
                        machine-readable structures, in parallel to the existing
                        human readable text, is undesirable because it creates
                        the potential for inconsistency.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        As an example, program code that describes how a protocol data
                        unit can be parsed might be provided as an appendix within a
                        standards document. This code would provide a specification of
                        the protocol that is separate to the prose description in the
                        main body of the document. This has the undesirable effect of
                        introducing the potential for the program code to specify behaviour
                        that the prose-based specification does not, and vice-versa.
                    </t>
                </dd>

                <dt>
                    Expressiveness:
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    <t>
                        Any approach should be expressive enough to capture the syntax
                        and parsing process for the majority of binary protocols. If a
                        given language is not sufficiently expressive, then adoption is
                        likely to be limited. At the limits of what can be expressed by
                        the language, authors are likely to revert to defining the
                        protocol in prose: this undermines the broad goal of using
                        structured and formal languages. Equally, though, understandable
                        specifications and ease of use are critical for adoption. A
                        tool that is simple to use and addresses the most common use
                        cases might be preferred to a complex tool that addresses all
                        use cases.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        It may be desirable to restrict expressiveness, however, to
                        guarantee intrinsic safety, security, and computability
                        properties of both the generated parser code for the protocol,
                        and the parser of the description language itself. In
                        much the same way as the language-theoretic security
                        (<xref target="LANGSEC"/>) community advocates for programming
                        language design to be informed by the desired properties of
                        the parsers for those languages, protocol designers should be
                        aware of the implications of their design choices. The
                        expressiveness of the protocol description languages that they use to
                        define their protocols can force such awareness.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Broadly, those languages that have grammars which are more expressive tend to
                        have parsers that are more complex and less safe. As a
                        result, while considering the other goals described in
                        this document, protocol description languages should attempt to be
                        minimally expressive, and either restrict protocol designs to
                        those for which safe and secure parsers can be generated, or
                        as a minimum, ensure that protocol designers are aware of the boundaries their
                        designs cross, in terms of computability and decidability <xref target="SASSAMAN" />.

                    <t>
                        Any approach should require as few changes as possible to the way
                        that documents are formatted, authored, and published. Forcing adoption
                        of a particular structured or formal language is incompatible with
                        the IETF's standardisation process: there are very few components
                        of standards documents that are non-optional.

            <t>
                The design principles described in <xref target="designprinciples"/> can
                largely be met by the existing uses of packet header diagrams. These
                diagrams aid human readability, do not require new or specialised
                tools to write, do not split the specification into multiple parts,
                can express most binary protocol features, and require no changes to
                existing publication processes.
            </t>
            <t>
                However, as discussed in <xref target="background-ascii"/> there are
                limitations to how packet header diagrams are used that must be addressed if they
                are to be parsed by machine. In this section, an augmented packet
                header diagram format is described.
            </t>
            <t>
                The concept is first illustrated by example. This is appropriate, given the visual
                nature of the language. In future drafts, these examples will be parsable using
                provided tools, and a formal specification of the augmented packet
                diagrams will be given in <xref target="ABNF"/>.

                <t>
                  The simplest PDU is one that contains only a set of fixed-width
                  fields in a known order, with no optional fields or variation
                  in the packet format.
                </t>

                <t>
                  Some packet formats include variable-width fields, where
                  the size of a field is either derived from the value of
                  some previous field, or is unspecified and inferred from
                  the total size of the packet and the size of the other
                  fields.
                </t>

                <t>
                  To ensure that there is no ambiguity, a PDU description
                  can contain only one field whose length is unspecified.
                  The length of a single field, where all other fields are
                  of known (but perhaps variable) length, can be inferred
                  from the total size of the containing PDU.
                </t>

                <t>
                  A PDU description is introduced by the exact phrase "A/An
                  _______ is formatted as follows:" at the end of a paragraph.
                  This is followed by the PDU description itself, as a packet
                  diagram within an &lt;artwork> element in the XML representation,
                  starting with a header line to show the bit width of the diagram.
                  The description of the fields follows the diagram, as an XML
                  &lt;dl> list, after a paragraph containing the text "where:".
                </t>

                <t>
                  PDU names must be unique, both within a document, and across
                  all documents that are linked together (i.e., using the
                  structured language defined in <xref target="ascii-import" />).
                </t>

                <t>
                  Each field of the description starts with a &lt;dt> tag
                  comprising the field name and an optional short name in
                  parenthesis. These are followed by a colon, the field
                  length, an optional presence expression (described in
                  <xref target="ascii-xref"/>), and a terminating period. The following &lt;dd>
                  tag contains a prose description of the field. Field names
                  cannot be the same as a previously defined PDU name, and must
                  be unique within a given structure definition.

                <t>
                  A document will set out different structures that are not, on their own, protocol data units.
                  To capture the parsing or serialisation of a protocol, it is necessary to be able to identify
                  or construct those packets that are valid PDUs. As a result, it is necessary for the document
                  to identify those structures that are PDUs.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The PDUs that comprise a protocol are identified using the
                  exact phrase "This document describes the &lt;protocol name>
                  protocol, The &lt;protocol name> protocol uses &lt;list of PDU
                  names>" where the list of PDU names is a comma separated list
                  (with the last element, if there is more than one element,
                  preceded by 'and'), each optionally preceded by "a" or "an".
                  The PDU names must be structure names defined in the document
                  or a linked document. The PDU names are pluralised in the
                  list. A document must contain exactly one instance of this
                  phrase.
                </t>
                <t>
                  This document describes the Example protocol. The Example protocol uses Single Field Headers, and Multiple Field Headers.

            <name>Security Considerations</name>
            <t>
                Poorly implemented parsers are a frequent source of security
                vulnerabilities in protocol implementations. Structuring the
                description of a protocol data unit so that a parser can be
                automatically derived from the specification can reduce the
                likelihood of vulnerable implementations.
            </t>
            <t>
                As described in <xref target="designprinciples"/>, the expressiveness
                of a protocol description language has implications for the safety,
                security, and computability properties of the parser for the protocol
                description language itself, and on the generated parser code for the
                protocols described using it. The language-theoretic security (<xref target="LANGSEC" />)
                community explores the security implications of programming language
                design; the principles developed in that community should guide the
                development of protocol description languages.
